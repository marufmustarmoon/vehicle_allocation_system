# Vehicle Allocation System

## Overview

The Vehicle Allocation System is a FastAPI application designed to manage employee vehicle allocations. This project utilizes MongoDB for data storage and Redis for caching, providing efficient access to employee and allocation data.

## Features

- Manage employees and their allocations
- Pagination for employee retrieval
- Caching with Redis for improved performance
- Includes endpoints for CRUD operations

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Docker (optional)

## Installation

### Without Docker Compose

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle_allocation_system.git
   cd vehicle_allocation_system
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB and Redis connection details:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname"
   REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
   ```

5. **Run the FastAPI application:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### With Docker Compose

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle_allocation_system.git
   cd vehicle_allocation_system
   ```

2. **Build and run the application with Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the FastAPI application, MongoDB, and Redis. The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3. **Stop the application:**

   To stop the application, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where you ran Docker Compose, or run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## API Endpoints

- **Get Employees with Allocations**
  - **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/employees/employees`
  - **Query Parameters:**
    - `include_allocations`: `true` or `false`
    - `skip`: Number of records to skip (for pagination)
